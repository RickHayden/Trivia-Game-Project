# Trivia-Game-Project
Project One

<Trivia Tree>: This is a 5 question trivia game that does not have a specific topic. The player must answer the question on each page correctly in order to move on to the next one, much like climbing a tree one branch at a time. If you answer incorrectly, have no fear for the game will let you try again until you get it right.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Next steps: I plan to disable the "Next" button until the player picks the correct answer, effectively blocking the path up the tree until the required answer is selected. I also plan to polish the style, artworrk, and fonts of each page with a common theme to create a more game-like feel.
